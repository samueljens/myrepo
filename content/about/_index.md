**Hello and welcome,**

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at Stony Brook University. My dissertation measures risk aversion of elected officials in the US Congress using speeches (text) from the Congressional Record. My committee is chaired by Professor Ryan Vander Wielen and includes Professor Michael Peress and Professor Stanley Feldman. 

The first chapter of my dissertation presents a methods-based approach for measuring traits of legislators using text/speech data. My second and third chapters examine how risk aversion influences the progressive ambition of House members and their legislative styles, respectively. 

Outside of school, I enjoy biking, camping, and GT3/4 racing.

Thank you for visiting my personal website! You may find my current CV at the top of the page. You may reach me via email at samuel [dot] jens [@] stonybrook [dot] edu.
