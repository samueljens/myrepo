**Hello and welcome,**

I am a recent PhD graduate from the Department of Political Science at Stony Brook University. My dissertation measures risk aversion of elected officials in the U.S. Congress using speeches (text) from the *Congressional Record*. My committee is chaired by Professor Ryan Vander Wielen and includes Professor Michael Peress and Professor Stanley Feldman. 

The first chapter of my dissertation presents a methods-based approach for measuring traits of legislators using text/speech data. My second and third chapters examine how risk aversion influences the progressive ambition of House members and their legislative styles, respectively. 

Outside of school, I enjoy biking, camping, and GT3/4 racing.

Thank you for visiting my personal website! You may find my current CV at the top of the page. You may reach me via email at samuel [dot] jens [@] stonybrook [dot] edu.
